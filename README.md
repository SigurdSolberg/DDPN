# DDPN

This repository provides tools and methodologies for computing the distributed homology of datasets. Key components include:

 - Distributed Homology Computation: Methods for extracting topological features from data.

 - Vectorization: Techniques to transform the computed homology into a format suitable for machine learning tasks.

 - Deep Set of Set Networks: Neural network architectures specifically designed to process the vectorized topological data.


The main.py file provides an example of how to use the code from this library to compute the distributed homology of a dataset of pointclouds and train a DDPN model using the resulting persistence diagrams.
